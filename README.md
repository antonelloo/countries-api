# Countries API
Countries API is a one-stop API for your world demographic needs. 

An example returned object for the country of Mexico:

{<br>
"capital": "Mexico City", <br>
"population": 128932753, <br>
"populationRank": 10, <br>
"lifeExpectancy": 75.41,<br>
"femaleLifeExpectancy": 78.17,<br>
"maleLifeExpectancy": 72.62,<br>
"lifeExpectancyRank": 90,<br>
"worldSharePopulation": 1.65,<br>
"totalArea": 758449,<br>
"totalAreaRank": 14,<br>
"worldShareTotalArea": 1.3<br>
}

The API is currently not hosted, as I am looking to expand it. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, node.js, Express

The API was made with node.js, using the Express framework.
